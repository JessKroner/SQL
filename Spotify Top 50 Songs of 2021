#In this project I downloaded the data of Spotify Top 50 Songs of 2021 from Kaggle. 
#Next, I created a table to insert the data. 
#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table and began quering the data as shown below:

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#1. Query a list of the top 20 songs and all of their data: 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#2. What is the title and artist of the #1 song in 2021? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE id is '1';

#3. List all of the songs from the artist with the #1 song:
SELECT artist_name, track_name 
FROM BIT_Db.Spotifydata 
WHERE artist_name is 'Olivia Rodrigo'; 

#4. What 3 artists have the most songs on the top 50 list and how many do each of them have? 
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS Title_Count 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY Title_count DESC LIMIT 3;

#5. What are the top 5 songs on the list? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata LIMIT 5;

#6. What is the average danceability and energy of the top 5 songs? 
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS Average_Dancability, AVG(energy) AS Average_Energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE id < 6;

#7. What is the average danceability and energy of the top 50? 
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS Average_Dancability, AVG(energy) AS Average_Energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#8. Create a playplist using the top 50 that have above average danceability and energy:
SELECT track_name, danceability, energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability > '.69' AND energy > '.65';

#9. What is the longest song on the top 50 list? 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, Max(duration_ms) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#10. What songs feature another artist? 
SELECT track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%Feat%';
