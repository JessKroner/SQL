## Here I have added a dataset to BigQuery & created a table from customer information stored in a CSV file and written the below SQL to process and clean the data.

##1. Reviewing customer_id information 
  #Returns duplicate entries for customer_id
SELECT
  customer_id
FROM `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`;

##2. Removing duplicates for accurate review of customer_id 
SELECT
  DISTINCT customer_id
FROM
`poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`;

##3. Confirming the data length of country data is consistent (length should = 2)
  #some country data fields contain length > 2
SELECT
  LENGTH(country) AS letters_in_country
FROM
  `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`;

##4. Identify what country data contains length > 2
  #Results yield country 'USA', which should be 'US'
SELECT 
  country
FROM
  `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`
WHERE
  LENGTH(country) > 2;

##5. Reviewing customer_id data where the country data first two letters = 'US'
  #Returns customers in 'US' and 'USA'
SELECT 
 DISTINCT customer_id
FROM 
  `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`
WHERE 
  SUBSTR(country,1,2) = 'US';

##6. Confirm state column has consistent number of letters
  #Returns one state (OH ) has length > 2
SELECT
  state
FROM
  `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`
WHERE
  LENGTH(state) > 2;

##7. Query list of all customer_id that life in 'OH'
  #Returns all customer_id data where the state is 'OH'
SELECT 
  DISTINCT customer_id
FROM
  `poetic-pottery-351322.customerData.customer_address`
WHERE 
  TRIM(state) = 'OH'
