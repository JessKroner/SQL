# Here I have created a table & imported a .csv dataset for bee colonies and their honey production from 1998 to 2012 from Kaggle.com. 

#1. Create a table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.HoneyProduction (
id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
state TEXT NOT NULL,
numcol INTEGER NOT NULL, 
yieldpercol INTEGER NOT NULL, 
totalprod INTEGER NOT NULL, 
Stocks INTEGER NOT NULL, 
priceperlb DECIMAL NOT NULL, 
prodvalue INTEGER NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL);

#2. What is the total lbs of honey produced during 1998 - 2012?
SELECT sum(totalprod) total_lbs_produced 
FROM BIT_DB.honeyproduction;

#3. What five years produced the lowest production value? 
SELECT year, SUM(prodvalue) annual_value 
FROM BIT_DB.HoneyProduction 
GROUP BY year 
ORDER BY prodvalue 
LIMIT 5;


#4. What is the total lbs produced by year? 
SELECT SUM(totalprod) total_lbs_produced, year 
FROM BIT_DB.HoneyProduction 
GROUP BY year 
ORDER BY year DESC;

#5.Which state produced the highest average of honey? 
SELECT AVG(totalprod) avg_lbs, state 
FROM BIT_DB.HoneyProduction 
GROUP BY state 
ORDER BY state DESC 
LIMIT 1;
