#In this SQL code, I'm quering a database of pokemon and their stats to answer questions about pokemon. 
#Database sourced from Github.Gist

#1. How many pokemon are in the database? 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Pokemon_Count FROM pokemon;

#2. How many pokemon species are in each pokemon type 1 category? 
SELECT type_1 AS "Type_of_Species", COUNT(name) AS Pokemon_Count FROM pokemon GROUP BY type_1 ORDER BY "Species";

#3. What is the average speed of the pokemon in the database? 
SELECT AVG(Speed) FROM pokemon;

#3. What is the average HP of the pokemon in the database? 
SELECT AVG(HP) FROM pokemon;

#4. The top 20 pokemon that have above average stats in HP & speeed:
SELECT Name AS Pokemon, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Species, HP AS Above_AVG_HP, Speed AS Above_AVG_Speed FROM pokemon GROUP BY Above_AVG_Speed HAVING Speed > 69 LIMIT 20;

#5. Determine the speed quality of 50 pokemon: 
SELECT Name AS Pokemon, Speed,
    CASE
        WHEN Speed = 68 THEN "Average"
        WHEN Speed > 68 THEN "Above Average"
        WHEN Speed < 68 THEN "Below Average"
        ELSE "N/A"
    END AS "Speed_Quality" FROM pokemon LIMIT 50; 

#6. What is the average attack score of the pokemon in the database? 
SELECT AVG(Attack) AS Average_Pokemon_Attack_Score FROM pokemon;

#7. How many pokemon have an above average attack score? 
SELECT COUNT(Attack) AS Pokemon_Attack_Above_Average FROM pokemon Where Attack > 79 ORDER BY Attack;

#8. What is the average attack score of each type 1 category? 
SELECT AVG(Attack) AS Average_Attack_Score, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Type FROM pokemon Group by Type_1;

#9. Query the top 20 pokemon with above average attack scores:
SELECT Name AS Top_20_Pokemon, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Type, Attack AS Above_Average_Attack FROM pokemon Where Attack > 79 ORDER BY Attack DESC LIMIT 20;

#10. Determine the attack quality of 50 pokemon:
SELECT Name AS Pokemon, Attack,
    CASE
        WHEN Attack = 79 THEN "Average"
        WHEN Attack > 79 THEN "Above Average"
        WHEN Attack < 79 THEN "Below Average"
        ELSE "N/A"
    END AS "Attack_Quality" FROM pokemon LIMIT 50;

#11. What is the average defense score of the pokemon in the database?
SELECT AVG(Defense) AS Average_Pokemon_Defense_Score FROM pokemon; 

#12. How many pokemon have an above average defense score? 
SELECT COUNT(Defense) AS Pokemon_Defense_Above_Average FROM pokemon Where Defense > 73 ORDER BY Defense;

#13. What is the average defense score of each type 1 category? 
SELECT AVG(Defense) AS Average_Pokemon_Defense_Score, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Type FROM pokemon GROUP BY Type_1; 

#14. Query the top 20 pokemon with above average defense scores:
SELECT Name AS Top_20_Pokemon, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Type, Defense AS Above_Average_Defense FROM pokemon Where Defense > 73 ORDER BY Defense DESC LIMIT 20;

#15. Determine the defense quality of 50 pokemon:
SELECT Name AS Pokemon, Defense,
    CASE
        WHEN Defense = 73 THEN "Average"
        WHEN Defense > 73 THEN "Above Average"
        WHEN Defense < 73 THEN "Below Average"
        ELSE "N/A"
    END AS "Defense_Quality" FROM pokemon LIMIT 50;
  
#16. Query the top 20 pokemon with above average attack and defense scores:
SELECT Name AS Top_20_Above_Average_Pokemon, Type_1 AS Pokemon_Type, Attack, Defense FROM pokemon Where Defense > 73 ORDER BY Defense AND Attack > 79 LIMIT 20;
